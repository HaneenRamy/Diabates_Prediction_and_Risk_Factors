# Diabetes Prediction and Risk Factors

This project focuses on predicting diabetes and analyzing key risk factors using machine learning. It was developed during **G-Camp by Google Developer Groups (GDG)**.

The goal is to transform raw health data into actionable insights that can support early detection and awareness of diabetes.
